# What is Docsify?
Docsify is a site generator that overall makes the process developing and building a website easy. In order to create a site, all you need to really know is the basic syntax of markdown, and you'll be able to build one in no time.

# Setting Docsify Up
Docisfy is a very user-friendly tool and gives a great rundown of how to properly set it up on their website. First, you must make sure you have Node.js downloaded and installed on your computer. Then, you must run a terminal (I used VS Code) to run a few commands and it will automatically put all of the necessary files in your directory. The two commands I used can be found below. 
> npm i docsify-cli -g

> docsify init ./docs

Once you have finished these steps, you should be good to start constructing your site.
